Press Any Key To Activate Normal Exit (PAKTANE) - Teo17

This block will end the level with the normal exit if
you press any key when inside it. This block has an
additional function of sound effect, open .ASM file
and search for:

	!Sound = No

It is the property for the sound effect. It's simple.
If you don't want any sound effect, type "No", just
like it is now, so if you don't want any sound effect,
leave it like this. If you want a sound effect, remove
the "No", and type "Yes", so you want a sound effect,
so it looks like this:

	!Sound = Yes

Make it act like tile 25 to get the best effect.
