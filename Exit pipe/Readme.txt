Pipe that Takes you to the Overworld - Teo17

I'm glad I could make these blocks. Thanks to Fakescaper for
the Pipe Kit Blocks. I hope these blocks will be useful.
No credit needed, but it would be appreciated. :)

These blocks are kind of "specific" blocks, and you need
some additional work to get them to work. (Don't worry,
those are just some simple settings)
Everything is exactly written in the instruction below. :)


Instruction about inserting:

1. Insert the Blocks just like usually. The Left Part of the
Pipe are the files ended with "L", and the Right Part of the
Pipe are the files ended with "R". Just insert both. If you want
player to go to the OW without activating events, use
"SideExitPipeL.asm" and "SideExitPipeR.asm". If you want the
player to activate the normal exit by entering the pipe, use
"NormExitPipeL.asm" and "NormExitPipeR.asm".

2. In this pack you downloaded, there's a file "PipePicture.png".
Open it an see how to insert these blocks into the level.
The "X" is the block "SideExitPipeL.asm" or "NormExitPipeL.asm".
The "Y" is the block "SideExitPipeR.asm" or "NormExitPipeR.asm".
The Pipe must be at least 3 tiles high, like on the picture.
Otherwise there can appear strange things.

3. Make this Block act like Tile 25. (Blank Block)

4. This is the last step. If you inserted the pipe correctly like
on the picture, everything should work except one thing. Before you
can start using these pipes, in Map16 Editor, enable Layer Priority
for all pipe tiles that use the custom blocks.
Otherwise when Mario enters the pipe, he won't be obscured by the
pipe and it will look really strangely.


I hope everything is understandable and you can insert the blocks
without any problem. I think they still can contain some bugs and
if you find any bugs, PM me. I hope everything goes well. :)
