Pass if no sprites on the Screen (PINSOTS) - made by Teo17.
This block is my first real block. It will be passable if there
are no sprites on the screen. Otherwise it won't be passable.
I wouldn't much recommend placing these blocks under blocks that
spawn sprites. They may throw Mario to the ledge and kill him.
Well, I hope it will work as it should. Make it act like tile 25
and enjoy! :)
